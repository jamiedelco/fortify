# Eclipse Complete Plugin

The Fortify Plugin for Eclipse, included with the Fortify SCA installer, consists of three separate plugin components:

Audit – Enables you to open existing scan results and audit them. These results include detailed descriptions of the security vulnerabilities detected and recommended remediation strategies. The audit plugin component helps security code inspection by enabling you to easily navigate to the source code location associated with each vulnerability, and then prioritize and audit the results.
Analysis – Enables you to initiate a Micro Focus Fortify Static Code Analyzer scan and analysis with Fortify security content, view the results, and fix the code associated with uncovered issues, all within the Eclipse IDE.
Collaboration – Includes server‑related functionality such as connecting to Micro Focus Fortify Software Security Center, uploading results to Fortify Software Security Center, and performing collaborative audits. (If you do not want this functionality, then there is no need to install the collaboration plugin.)
Note: For information about supported versions of Eclipse, see the Micro Focus Fortify Software System Requirements document.

# Fortify Remediation Plugin for Eclipse
The Fortify Remediation Plugin for Eclipse included with the Fortify SCA installer (Eclipse Remediation Plugin) works in conjunction with Micro Focus Fortify Software Security Center to add remediation functionality to your software security analysis from the Eclipse IDE. The Eclipse Remediation Plugin is a lightweight plugin option for developers who do not need the scanning and auditing capabilities of Audit Workbench and the Eclipse Complete Plugin.

The Eclipse Remediation Plugin enables developers to quickly and easily understand the reported vulnerabilities and implement appropriate solutions.

Developers can address security issues while they write code in Eclipse. Your organization can use the Eclipse Remediation Plugin with Fortify Software Security Center to manage projects and assign specific issues to the relevant developers.
